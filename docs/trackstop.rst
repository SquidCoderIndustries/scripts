This script provides 2 overlays that are managed by the `overlay` framework. The script does nothing when executed.
The trackstop overlay allows the player to change the friction and dump direction of a selected track stop after it has been constructed.
The rollers overlay allows the player to change the roller direction and speed of a selected roller after it has been constructed.
