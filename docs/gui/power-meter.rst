.. dfhack-tool::
    :summary: Allow pressure plates to measure power.
    :tags: unavailable

If you run this tool after selecting :guilabel:`Pressure Plate` in the build
menu, you will build a power meter building instead of a regular pressure plate.
This means that, once the building is built, you can select it to see a
readout of how much power is being supplied to gear boxes built in the four
adjacent N/S/W/E tiles.
