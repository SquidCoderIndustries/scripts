==============

.. dfhack-tool::
    :summary: Visualize minecart guide paths.
    :tags: unavailable

This tool displays the cached path that will be used by the minecart guide
order. The game computes this path when the order is executed for the first
time, so you have to wait for a dwarf to have started pushing the minecart
at least once before you can visualize the path.

To use, select a :guilabel:`Guide` order in the :guilabel:`Hauling` menu with
the cursor and run this tool.
