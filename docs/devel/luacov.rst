.. dfhack-tool::
    :summary: Lua script coverage report generator.
    :tags: dev

This script generates a coverage report from collected statistics. By default it
reports on every Lua file in all of DFHack. To filter filenames, specify one or
more Lua patterns matching files or directories to be included. Alternately, you
can configure reporting parameters in the .luacov file in your DF directory. See
https://keplerproject.github.io/luacov/doc/modules/luacov.defaults.html for
details.

Statistics are cumulative across reports. That is, if you run a report, run a
lua script, and then run another report, the report will include all activity
from the first report plus the recently run lua script. Restarting DFHack will
clear the statistics. You can also clear statistics after running a report by
passing the ``--clear`` flag to this script.

Note that the coverage report will be empty unless you have started DFHack with
the "DFHACK_ENABLE_LUACOV=1" environment variable defined, which enables the
coverage monitoring.

Also note that enabling coverage monitoring and lua profiling (via the
"profiler" module) at the same time can produce strange results. Their
interceptor hooks conflict with each other. Usage of the `kill-lua` command will
likewise override the luacov interceptor hook and may prevent coverage
statistics from being collected.

Usage
-----

::

    luacov [options] [pattern...]

Examples
--------

``devel/luacov``
    Report on all DFHack lua scripts.
``devel/luacov -c quickfort``
    Report only on quickfort source files and then clear the stats. This is
    useful to run between test runs to see the coverage of your test changes.
``devel/luacov quickfort hack/lua``
    Report only on quickfort and DFHack library lua source files.

Options
-------

``-c``, ``--clear``
    Remove accumulated metrics after generating the report, ensuring the next
    report starts from a clean slate.
