fix/empty-wheelbarrows
======================

.. dfhack-tool::
    :summary: Empties stuck items from wheelbarrows.
    :tags: fort bugfix items

Empties all wheelbarrows which contain rocks that have become 'stuck' in them.

This works around the issue encountered with :bug:`6074`, and should be run
if you notice wheelbarrows lying around with rocks in them that aren't
being used in a task. This script is set to run periodically by default in
`gui/control-panel`.
