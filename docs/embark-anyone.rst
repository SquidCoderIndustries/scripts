    :tags: embark armok

When run, you can add any civilization, including dead or non-dwarven civilizations,
to the list of choices.


Usage
-----

::

    embark-anyone

Note
-----
Non-dwarven civs have their own mechanics and are likely to lack recipes which can render fortress mode difficult
or unplayable. Preparing carefully is advised, and some crucial items may need to be
spawned in with other DFHack tools (e.g. `gui/create-item`). Additionally, missing crafting recipes can be added using `add-recipe`.
