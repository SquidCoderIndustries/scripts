    :summary: Adventure as any living historical figure.
    :tags: adventure embark armok

This tool allows you to play as any living (or undead) historical figure (except
for deities) in adventure mode.

To use, simply run the command at the start of adventure mode character
creation. You will be presented with a searchable list from which you may choose
your desired historical figure.

This figure will be added to the list of people to choose from during character
creation (the "Specific person" option on the race list). They can then be
picked for use as a player character, the same as when regaining control of a
retired adventurer.
