====================================

.. dfhack-tool::
    :summary: Help create reaction triggers.
    :tags: unavailable

Prints useful things to the console and a file to help modders
transition from ``autoSyndrome`` to `modtools/reaction-trigger`.

This script is basically an apology for breaking backward
