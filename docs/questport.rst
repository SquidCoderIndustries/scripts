questport
=========

.. dfhack-tool::
    :summary: Teleport to your quest log map cursor.
    :tags: unavailable

If you open the quest log map and move the cursor to your target location, you
can run this command to teleport straight there. This can be done both within
and outside of fast travel mode, and it is possible to ``questport`` in
situations where fast travel is normally prohibited.

It is not possible to ``questport`` into inaccessible locations like ocean and
mountain tiles.

See `reveal-adv-map` if you wish to teleport into hidden map tiles.
