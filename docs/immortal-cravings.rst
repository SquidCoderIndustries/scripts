    :summary: Allow immortals to satisfy their cravings for food and drink.
    :tags: fort gameplay

When enabled, this script watches your fort for units that have no physiological
need to eat or drink but still have personality needs that can only be satisfied
by eating or drinking (e.g. necromancers or goblins). This enables those units
to help themselves to a drink or a meal when they crave one and are not
otherwise occupied.
