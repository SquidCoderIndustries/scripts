Sound the alarm! This tool can shake your sleeping units awake and knock some
sense into your party animal military dwarves so they can address a siege.

Note that this is not without consequences. Affected dwarves will receive a
negative thought about noise, tiredness, and lack of protection.

Usage
-----

::

    siren [<burrow> ...]

Examples
--------

``siren``
    Wake up the whole fort!
``siren barracks tavern``
    Just affect dwarves that are within the bounds of the ``barracks`` and
    ``tavern`` burrows (note that the dwarves do not need to be *assigned* to
    those burrows).
