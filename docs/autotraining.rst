    :summary: Assigns citizens to a military squad until they have fulfilled their need for Martial Training
    :tags: fort auto bugfix units

Automation script for citizens to hit the gym when they yearn for the gains. Also passively builds military skills and physical stats.

You need to have at least one squad that is set up for training. This should be a new non-military-use squad. The uniform should be
set to "No Uniform" and the squad should be set to "Constant Training" in the military screen. Edit the squad's schedule to full time training with around 8 units training.
The squad doesn't need months off. The members leave the squad once they have gotten their gains.

Once you have made squads for training use `gui/autotraining` to select the squads and ignored units, as well as the needs threshhold.
